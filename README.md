## TODO / Ideas

- Material3 Scores widget using Glance APIs
- NBA, WNBA (and maybe college?) scores
- Launch a Activity to configure what scores are shown, select favorite teams, other configuration?
- **Dark / Light mode auto switch**
- Custom theming
- Palette API pull colors from Wallpaper
- Super Resizable
    - Small "chip" size which narrow and just shows single game score
    - Wide normal
    - longer turns into a scrollable list that shows more than one game
    - Build logic
    - Multiplatform?
